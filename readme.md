# Microlite20 Character Generator

Hello! I'm about to start a campaign in Microlite20, but I'm to lazy to print and go through the process of character creation with every player (even if that process is super fast in Microlite20).

That's why I've created this app. Simply, choose your name, choose your class, and choose your way of setting up your stats, then print your character sheet, and it's ready.

You can play around with the app here: http://angrymaya.pl/react/dark-souls/ (Yeah, it's in folder "dark-souls" becouse the campaign will be heavly inspired by it).
